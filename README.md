This is my GitHub Pages website, used to host my portfolio. It's written in Angular.

There are two branches of this repository:
**1.** master- The source code of the project.
**2.** gh-pages- The compiled website that is deployed to github pages.

[Here's](https://adamapplegate.github.io) a link to the site.
